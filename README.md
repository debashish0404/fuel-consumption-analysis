#Introduction
Fuel efficiency plays an important role in vehicle performance, cost savings, and environmental
sustainability. This project analyzes vehicle fuel consumption using Python and real-world data to
understand how factors like weight and horsepower affect fuel efficiency.

#Problem Statement
To analyze vehicle fuel consumption and understand the relationship between MPG, weight, and
horsepower using data analysis techniques.

#Dataset Description
The Auto MPG dataset contains vehicle data such as MPG, weight, and horsepower. It is widely
used for beginner-level machine learning and data analysis projects.

#Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Google Colab

#Methodology
The dataset was loaded and converted into a Pandas DataFrame. Statistical analysis was
performed, followed by data visualization. Manual fuel efficiency was calculated and compared with
dataset values.

#Results
Heavier and higher-horsepower vehicles generally show lower fuel efficiency. Manual fuel
calculation showed realistic comparison with dataset averages.

#Conclusion
This project helped in understanding real-world data analysis using Python and strengthened
fundamentals of data visualization and statistics
